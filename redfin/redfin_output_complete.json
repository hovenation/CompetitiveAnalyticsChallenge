As a participant in the Anaheim Mills Act Program it benefits from a significant reduction in property taxes for being maintained in its historic condition. It is one of the few homes in this area featuring the original carriage house (now a guest house) which is completely independent from the main home which could be used as a studio, for in-laws, guests, or as an income producing rental. Altogether there is approximately 1750 square feet of living space. The curb appeal of this historic home includes an eco-friendly garden, overlooked by the pleasant front porch with its column supported pergola, exposed rafters and 3 sets of French doors. There is wood laminate in living room, dining area, bedroom and hallway. The spacious kitchen features a Dutch door, California cooler pantry, new counter tops, a black composite sink, and  breakfast room. In addition to central air conditioning an attic fan was installed last August which, keeps home about 10 degrees cooler in hot summer months. Enjoy everything Downtown Anaheim has to offer within walking distance (see all photos). ",

Built in 1919 as one of two nearly identical homes constructed right next door to each other for the Lautenbach and Links families. There is a beautiful front porch, shaded by a mature oak tree which motif matches the gorgeous bronze front door hardware. There is a formal living room and dining room that is unaltered by any \u201cfad\u201d and is pure with its unfinished wood trim, built in bookcases, secretary desk, leaded glass windows, built in buffet and graceful high ceilings.  The current owner built a kitchen to match the existing elements of the home. Plentiful cabinets, gorgeous vintage stove and lots of natural light.The third bedroom is a great office because of its size and offers a gorgeous permitted bathroom with marble flooring and subway tile wainscoting. The main Jack and Jill bath has a unique six foot long claw foot tub.  This home may be eligible for the Mills Act, very eligible, and will be ready for the new owner to follow through on this \u201cbadge of honor\u201d.Located just blocks away from The Anaheim Packing House, Farmer\u2019s Park and Center St. Promenade.

The luxurious bath features a dual, granite-topped vanity with plentiful cabinets and glass-enclosed shower.    Retreat to a cozy loft with private bath that is a perfect office, playroom or second master suite. Clever details include a step-down seating area with built-in storage bench and skylight overhead.
